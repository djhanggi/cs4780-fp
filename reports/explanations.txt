Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering

Our kNN implementation in this research project was used to predict musical traits
of songs based on the probable hypothesis that songs within the same genre have similar
musical properties (danceability, valence, tempo, etc.) To further correlate the
relevance of musical features in genrification, we used hierarchical agglomerative
clustering to study how genres emerge in our music data set. Specifically, we sought
to examine whether the clustering corresponds to well-defined (classified by real-world
musical experts) genres, and whether or not songs' nearest neighbors (in the kNN
implementation) are contained with the clustering found via HAC. This would demonstrate
the importance of particular features in the data set, and would indicate if
genres are defined by a range of musical features or whether features are sparse
throughout the feature space.

Our HAC implementation in MATLAB used the single-link (minimum distance), complete-link
(maximum distance), and average-link (average distance) methods to cluster our
song data set. The distance metric we used was Euclidean distance applied to
the song's VT transformation and valence.
