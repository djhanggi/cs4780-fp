Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
=====================================

Our kNN implementation in this research project was used to predict musical traits
of songs based on the probable hypothesis that songs within the same genre have similar
musical properties (danceability, valence, tempo, etc.) To further correlate the
relevance of musical features in genrification, we used hierarchical agglomerative
clustering to study how genres emerge in our music data set. Specifically, we sought
to examine whether the clustering corresponds to well-defined (classified by real-world
musical experts) genres, and whether or not songs' nearest neighbors (in the kNN
implementation) are contained with the clustering found via HAC. This would demonstrate
the importance of particular features in the data set, and would indicate if
genres are defined by a range of musical features or whether features are sparse
throughout the feature space.

Our HAC implementation in MATLAB used the single-link (minimum distance), complete-link
(maximum distance), and average-link (average distance) methods to cluster our
song data set. The distance metric we used was Euclidean distance applied to
the song's VT transformation and valence.


Connections between HAC and KNN
===============================

We added the HAC portion of this project for several reasons; to determine the
connection between musical features (in our data space) and genre; to compare
supervised and unsupervised methods in our classification; to determine how our
kNN and HAC algorithms compare while using the VT transformation; and to see
if these algorithms provide similar insights.

Our primary conclusion from the results of both algorithms is that there is a
feature not being considered in song classification. For some songs, there is not
a strong correspondence between how they are clustered and how they are classified
via kNN. We believe the most significant missing feature is lyrical content, which
could aid in the classification of songs; however, this feature is difficult to
integrate into our current feature representation as lyrics are common to many different
genres. Lyrical content would have to be considered alongside musical features to
be able to segregate genres.
